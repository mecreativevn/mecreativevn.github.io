If after 30 days the parties are unable to resolve any dispute raised under the previous provision, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration consistent with this Section. The parties understand that they would have had a right or opportunity to litigate disputes through a court and to have a judge or jury decide their case, but they choose to have any disputes resolved through arbitration. C.

D. We are entering into this arbitration agreement in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce. Accordingly, this arbitration agreement and any proceedings thereunder shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-16. Any award by the arbitrator(s) may be entered as a judgment in any court having jurisdiction. E. Exception to Arbitrate. Either of us may bring qualifying claims in small claims court. Further, as set forth below, we each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and AIAR Labs, not as part of a classwide claim (i.e., not brought on behalf of or together with another individual's claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn't apply and the classwide dispute must be brought in court.<br><br><strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS <br></strong><br> TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING. <br><br><strong>NO TRIAL BY JURY </strong><br><br> TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING. <br><br><strong>AMENDMENT; ADDITIONAL TERMS </strong><br><br> A.

Advertising IDs are non-permanent device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising. <br><br> These advertisers and third party advertising and analytics partners may collect and use data and information about you, such as your Service session activity, viewing of and interaction with an advertisement, device identifier, geo-location information and IP address for the purposes of analyzing, tracking and measuring advertisement performance and to provide interest based advertising. <br><br> In addition, you may see our applications and games advertised in other services. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our application or game, you will become a user of our Service. In order to verify the installs, a device identifier may be shared with the advertiser or third party advertiser or analytics partner. <br><br> You can exercise an opt-out for interest based advertising services on mobile applications by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest based ads" (Android). If you would like to adjust your choices regarding the use of precise location data, you may also do so via your mobile device settings. Finally, many of our partner's that enable online behavioral or interest based advertising are members of one or more digital advertising industry self-regulatory programs. You may click below for the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") to learn more about targeted or interest based advertising and to opt out of certain targeting programs. <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a> <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> <br><br> <strong>2.
